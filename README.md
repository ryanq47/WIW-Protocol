# WIW-Protocol
The "Wait it works?" protocol - A custom(ish) protocol I designed for use with the Logec Suite.  Currently in Python for dev purposes.

There are 2 version, one that is class based, and one that is not. The class version is intended to be used as an import, whereas the classless is better for more adhoc/integration into existing structures.

Notes: These are POC's at the moment, I haven't implemented full error handling or thoroughly tested every scenario. Use at your own risk.
